Source codes to compute evolving closeness centralities in time evolving graphs:

1. Graphs with both edge insertions and deletions
(closeness.centrality.deletion.TimeEvolvingGraphDecremental)

The file contains implementations for ECC algorithm and dynamic SSSP baseline algorithm.

2. Graphs with only edge insertions
(closeness.centrality.insertion.TimeEvolvingGraphIncremental)

The file contains implementations for ECCI algorithm and dynamic SSSP baseline algorithm.
